# Data_Science-Exam_Project
The focus of this assignment is to find the car models that have developed most in context of pollution, year, price and city.

This is interesting because we want to be able to choose a car that pollutes the least, for a small price. This will also work as an advertisement for the car companies. 

We expect to end up with some good models that can be used by the car companies to attract more customers. We also expect to be able to predict something by the correlation of different attributes. 

Both the car companies and customers will be able to use our results.
